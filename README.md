Purpose: To display to the user the words used in an RSS feeds with the number of occurrences of each word, in decreasing order.  The user decides which
RSS Feed they'd like to use, and the results are then generated through a Python server using Bottle.py.

Source of RSS Feeds:

CNN - http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/ <br />
NPR - http://www.npr.org/rss/   <br />
NYTimes - http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html <br />
More cool feeds to browse and try:
NASA feeds- https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-rss-feeds <br />

Hopes:
-To test a wider variety of RSS feeds to make sure that the server's handling of RSS is adequate.<br />
-To figure out why certain non-alphanumeric characters are not being removed with my algorithm.<br />
-To give the option of eliminating common words (i.e. "the", "and", etc.) or just a specified list of words.<br />
-To allow for the user to increase the number of entries they would like the data to contain.<br />
-To meet someone that could possibly use this program or a close variation of it for legitimate research to
make meaning out of word patterns.  Maybe a linguistics or psychology person or someone.
that studies media, or maybe human computer interaction.  Not sure, but that would be cool.
