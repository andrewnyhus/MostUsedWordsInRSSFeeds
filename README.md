Purpose: To display in to the user the most common words used in various RSS feeds for a specified number of entries in those feeds.  The user chooses which feeds and the number of entries.

This application will be using python to parse the rss feeds and calculate the words and their frequencies.  It will then use the Python web-framework "Bottle" (see link: http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html#) as a server to distribute the web code to display in the users browser, and will receive notifications of the users actions and act accordingly.
